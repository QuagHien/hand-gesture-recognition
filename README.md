# Hand gesture recognition
A research paper on hand gesture recognition using the CVZONE library, an important part in improving human-computer interaction. A research paper on hand gesture recognition has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 9th International Conference on Intelligent Information Technology (ICIIT 2024), which will take place in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in February 2024. The paper can be accessed via the  ![DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/3654522.3654540).

## Quick Start
Clone this project and install the required packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/QuagHien/hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE.git
pip install -r hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE/requirements.txt
```
## Hand gesture recognition
We have a model to identify cheating in multiple-choice exams:
```
python3 hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE/HandGestureRecognitionusingCVZONE.py
```
You can experience a simple model of hand gesture recognition at [MediaPipe Studio](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/demo/gesture_recognizer) developed by Google.
