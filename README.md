# Hand gesture recognition using CVZONE
This research investigates the use of the ’cvzone’ library for hand gesture recognition, which is an important part of improving human- computer interaction.  
## 21 coordinates representing the positions of hand joints

## Results
We use the accuracy metric to evaluate the model.

## Quick Start
Clone this project and install the required packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/QuagHien/hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE.git
pip install -r hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE/requirements.txt
```
## Hand gesture recognition
We have a model to identify cheating in multiple-choice exams:
```
python3 hand-gesture-recognition-using-CVZONE/HandGestureRecognitionusingCVZONE.py
```
You can experience a simpler model of mine at [MediaPipe Studio](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/demo/gesture_recognizer) developed by Google.
